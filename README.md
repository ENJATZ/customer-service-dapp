# Customer Service dApp

The Customer Service Dapp is a proposed web application that would make it easier for dapps on the Internet Computer (IC) to provide customer service to their users.

It allows customer service reps to create links that can be sent to users to call specific functions from their principal, even if the current front end dapp does not expose the function or if the integration is broken.

## ICDevs.org Bounty

This solution is targeting the ICDevs bounty: https://icdevs.org/bounties/2023/03/24/50-Customer-Service-Dapp.html.

## Developing

Once you've cloned the repository and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
